# Pomodoro-Timer-App üçÖ
A timer app which employs the Pomodoro time management technique to break up study/work sessions into work-break intervals, using the tkinter module to create the GUI.
The app notifies the user at the beginning of each work-break interval.

## Requirements
* [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/)

## Usage
Run 'main.py' using Python3

## The Pomodoro Timer App works like this:

1. Decide what you want to accomplish and estimate how long you will work for. Then break your work into <i>pomodoros</i> (25-minute sessions).

2. Click the <b>START</b> button to begin your first 25-minute work session. Use this time to work without distractions.

3. At the end of the work period, the app will emit a <b><i>beep</i></b> sound to alert you, and your short 5-minute break will begin.
A green check mark will appear at the bottom of the app, helping you keep track of each work session completed.

4. At the end of this short break, you've completed one <i>pomodoro</i> - you'll hear another <b><i>beep</i></b>.

5. The cycle then repeats and a new <i>pomodoro</i> work session will begin. After four <i>pomodoros</i>, you'll be prompted to take a longer 20-minute break.
At the end of this, you'll have completed a full cycle.

6. The Pomodoro Timer App will count down until you either hit the <b>RESET</b> button or exit out of the program.
